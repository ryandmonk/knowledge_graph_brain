- **API Behavior**: Ingest endpoint now uses dynamic connector resolution instead of hardcoded logic

### Migration Guide
For existing custom schemas, add `connector_url` to your mappings:
```yaml
mappings:
  sources:
    - source_id: "your-source"
      connector_url: "http://localhost:port/endpoint"  # Add this line
      document_type: "your-type"
      # ... rest of mapping
```

This release transforms the Knowledge Graph Brain from a demo system with hardcoded examples into a truly scalable, infinitely extensible knowledge graph platform, setting the foundation for v1.0.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-24 - Critical Test Infrastructure & Core Functionality Fixes

### Fixed

  - Enhanced `applyMapping` function to create both source and target nodes from relationship definitions
  - Resolved issue where Person nodes weren't being created from edge definitions
  - Complete end-to-end pipeline now working: schema validation ‚Üí registration ‚Üí ingestion ‚Üí Neo4j population

- **üß™ Test Infrastructure Overhaul**
  - Fixed API signature mismatches in `executeCypher` function calls (corrected 3-param to 2-param format)
  - Resolved dynamic import issues by converting to static imports (eliminated "experimental-vm-modules" errors)
