### Migration Guide
For existing custom schemas, add `connector_url` to your mappings:
```yaml
mappings:
  sources:
    - source_id: "your-source"
      connector_url: "http://localhost:port/endpoint"  # Add this line
      document_type: "your-type"
      # ... rest of mapping
```

This release transforms the Knowledge Graph Brain from a demo system with hardcoded examples into a truly production-ready, infinitely scalable knowledge graph platform.
