## Expected Agent Behavior

For each question, the agent should:

1. ‚úÖ **Use kb_info** to understand the schema
2. ‚úÖ **Use semantic_search** to find relevant content  
3. ‚úÖ **Use search_graph** to explore relationships
4. ‚úÖ **Synthesize** a comprehensive answer with citations
5. ‚úÖ **Provide node IDs** and key properties as evidence
6. ‚úÖ **Assess confidence** level in the response

## Sample Output Format

```
üîç Processing your question...

üìã Search Steps:

1. Retrieved knowledge base schema and info

2. Performed semantic search for relevant content  
   Tool: semantic_search
   Result: {"found": 3, "results": [{"node_id": "doc-123", "score": 0.95, ...}]}

3. Executed graph query to find relationships
   Tool: search_graph  
   Result: {"found": 5, "rows": [{"from_type": ["Document"], ...}]}
